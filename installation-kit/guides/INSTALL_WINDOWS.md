    - Press **Enter**
    - You should see something like `conda 23.X.X`
    
    *üì∏ [Screenshot placeholder: Command prompt showing conda version]*

**‚ùå If you get an error like "'conda' is not recognized":**
- Close the command prompt
- Restart your computer
- Try again
- If it still doesn't work, see the Troubleshooting section below

### Phase 4: Create Your Data Science Environment

12. **Download the environment file:**
    - Go back to your bootcamp folder
    - Find the file called `ds-bootcamp-env.yml` in the `installation-kit/environments/` folder
    - **Remember where you saved it!**

13. **In Command Prompt, navigate to the folder:**
    - If you saved it in Downloads, type: `cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads`
    - If you saved it elsewhere, type: `cd` followed by the path to your folder

14. **Create the environment:**
    - Type: `conda env create -f ds-bootcamp-env.yml`
    - Press **Enter**
    - **This will take 15-30 minutes** - go grab a coffee! ‚òï
    
    *üì∏ [Screenshot placeholder: Terminal showing environment creation progress]*

15. **Activate your environment:**
    - Type: `conda activate ds-bootcamp`
    - Press **Enter**
    - Your command prompt should now show `(ds-bootcamp)` at the beginning

### Phase 5: Set Up Jupyter Widgets

16. **Install additional extensions:**
    ```
    jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
    jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable --user
    jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix
    ```
    - Copy and paste these one at a time, pressing Enter after each

17. **Test Jupyter:**
    - Type: `jupyter notebook`
    - Press **Enter**
    - Your web browser should open with Jupyter running
    - You should see a page that says "Jupyter" at the top
    
    *üì∏ [Screenshot placeholder: Jupyter notebook home page]*

## üéâ Success Check

### Verify Everything Works

1. **In Jupyter, create a new notebook:**
   - Click **New** ‚Üí **Python 3**

2. **Test basic functionality:**
   - In the first cell, type: `import pandas as pd`
   - Press **Shift + Enter**
   - If no error appears, you're good!

3. **Test widgets:**
   - In a new cell, type:
   ```python
   import ipywidgets as widgets
   slider = widgets.IntSlider(value=5, min=0, max=10)
   slider
   ```
   - Press **Shift + Enter**
   - You should see a slider you can move!

**üéä Congratulations! You're ready for the bootcamp!**

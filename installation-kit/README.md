## 🎯 Quick Start - Choose Your Path

### Step 1: Find Your Operating System

**Don't know which you have?**
- **Windows:** Look for the Windows logo on your keyboard or Start menu
- **Mac:** Look for the Apple logo (🍎) in the top-left corner of your screen
- **Linux:** If you're not sure, you probably don't have Linux 😊

### Step 2: Follow Your Guide

Click on your operating system guide and follow every step:

| Operating System | Guide | Time Needed |
|------------------|-------|-------------|
| 🖥️ **Windows**   | [📖 INSTALL_WINDOWS.md](guides/INSTALL_WINDOWS.md) | 30-45 min |
| 🍎 **macOS**     | [📖 INSTALL_MAC.md](guides/INSTALL_MAC.md) | 30-45 min |
| 🐧 **Linux**     | [📖 INSTALL_LINUX.md](guides/INSTALL_LINUX.md) | 20-30 min |

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

After installation, test your setup:

1. **Quick Test** (30 seconds):
   ```bash
   python scripts/quick_test.py
   ```

2. **Full Verification** (2 minutes):
   ```bash
   python scripts/verify_setup.py
   ```

3. **Interactive Test** (5 minutes):
   - Open Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
   - Open and run: `scripts/test_notebook.ipynb`

## 👨‍🏫 For Instructors

### Class Preparation Checklist

**Before Class:**
- [ ] Send installation kit to students 1-2 weeks early
- [ ] Recommend students try installation before first class
- [ ] Have backup plan for students with installation issues
- [ ] Test the environment file on multiple platforms

**First Class:**
- [ ] Have students run `python scripts/verify_setup.py`

- [ ] Show how to start Jupyter and navigate to bootcamp materials

**Backup Solutions:**
- Online Jupyter environments (Google Colab, Binder)
- Pre-installed laptops for students with persistent issues
- Pair programming for students without laptops

### Customization

The environment file (`environments/ds-bootcamp-env.yml`) can be customized:
- Add/remove packages as needed
- Pin specific versions for reproducibility
- Add additional channels if needed

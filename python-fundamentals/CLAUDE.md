## Teaching Guidelines

### Live Coding Best Practices

1. **Start with Blank Notebooks**: Always begin lessons with empty cells
2. **Type Together**: Students must type every character alongside you
3. **Explain While Typing**: Narrate your thought process as you code
4. **Frequent Breaks**: Pause every 15-20 minutes for questions
5. **Error Demonstration**: Deliberately make and fix common mistakes
6. **Student Predictions**: Ask students to predict output before running cells

### Pacing and Timing

- **2-hour sessions**: 90 minutes content + 30 minutes practice/Q&A
- **3-hour sessions**: 2.5 hours content + 30 minutes project work/review
- **Break every 45-60 minutes**: Essential for virtual format
- **Leave 10-15 minutes buffer**: For unexpected questions or slower typing

### Engagement Techniques

1. **Analogy Reinforcement**: Consistently return to established analogies
2. **Predictive Questioning**: "What do you think will happen if...?"
3. **Error Analysis**: When errors occur, analyze them together
4. **Real-World Connections**: Constantly relate to business/data science uses
5. **Progress Celebration**: Acknowledge each breakthrough moment

### Assessment Approach

#### Formative Assessment (During Class)
- **Live Coding Participation**: Can students type along successfully?
- **Concept Explanation**: Can they explain analogies back to you?
- **Error Recovery**: How quickly do they identify and fix mistakes?
- **Predictive Thinking**: Can they anticipate code behavior?

#### Summative Assessment (Projects/Homework)
- **Week 1 Project**: 25% of grade - Basic syntax and data structures
- **Week 2 Project**: 25% of grade - Logic and functions
- **Capstone Project**: 40% of grade - Complete application
- **Homework Completion**: 10% of grade - Consistent practice

### Common Student Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Syntax Overwhelm
**Symptoms**: Students get lost in parentheses, quotes, indentation
**Solution**: 
- Use the LEGO analogy - each symbol is a connector piece
- Practice typing exercises focused on punctuation
- Create visual guides for common patterns

#### Challenge 2: Conceptual vs. Practical Gap
**Symptoms**: Understand concepts but can't apply them
**Solution**:
- Always start with analogy, then show code, then practice
- Use the "chef following recipe" approach - step by step
- Provide templates with TODO comments

#### Challenge 3: Fear of Breaking Things
**Symptoms**: Hesitation to experiment or try variations
**Solution**:
- Demonstrate that errors are learning opportunities
- Show how to read error messages as helpful hints
- Create "safe sandbox" exercises for experimentation

#### Challenge 4: Moving Too Fast Between Concepts
**Symptoms**: Lost students, increasing questions about earlier topics
**Solution**:
- Use the filing cabinet analogy - organize knowledge properly
- Regular "knowledge check" moments
- Spiral back to reinforce earlier concepts in new contexts

### Virtual Teaching Tips

1. **Screen Setup**: Share code editor full screen, use large font (16pt minimum)
2. **Audio Quality**: Use headset microphone for clear communication
3. **Recording**: Record sessions for student review (if permitted)
4. **Chat Monitoring**: Assign teaching assistant to monitor chat questions
5. **Breakout Rooms**: Use for small group problem-solving during long sessions

## Technical Setup

### Required Software (Students)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- VS Code (optional but recommended for later development)
- Git (for accessing course materials)

### Course Materials Access
```bash

    "1. **Conditionals**: Describe a situation where you used nested if-elif-else statements. Why was this approach better than alternatives?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loops**: Compare for loops vs while loops. When would you choose one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Functions**: How did functions help you organize your code in the restaurant management system? Give specific examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Solving\n",
    "4. **Debugging**: What was the most challenging bug you encountered? How did you solve it?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Algorithm Design**: In the sales analysis exercise, how did you approach breaking down the complex requirements into smaller, manageable pieces?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Code Reusability**: Give an example of where you created a function that you used multiple times. How did this improve your code?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application\n",
    "7. **Real-world Connections**: How could the restaurant management system concepts apply to other domains (e.g., library systems, inventory management)?\n",
